## Introduction

The metadata of a given runtime is a critical piece of information: it can be seen as the signature of a runtime.
It contains the exhaustive list of all the features publicly exposed by the runtime.

Any node can be queried to provide its current metadata. This can be displayed in json format for instance. This is a great way to have a peek at what the runtime can do.

## Sample runs

![subwasm diff](scripts/demos/gif/demo-diff.gif)

## Capabilities

`subwasm` allows:

-   getting the latest metadata from a running node

-   getting the latest runtime (wasm) from a running node

-   getting runtime and metadata at any point of time using a Block hash as reference

-   getting the metadata from a a wasm file without any node

-   extracting information (those not requiring storage) from a runtime as wasm file

### Command: get

    subwasm-get 0.12.1
    chevdor <chevdor@gmail.com>:Wilfried Kopp <wilfried@parity.io
    Get/Download the runtime wasm from a running node through rpc

    USAGE:
        subwasm get [OPTIONS] [url]

    ARGS:
        <url>    The node url. Example: ws://localhost:9944 or http://localhost:9933 [default:
                 http://localhost:9933]

    FLAGS:
        -h, --help       Prints help information
        -V, --version    Prints version information

    OPTIONS:
        -b, --block <block>      The optional block where to fetch the runtime. That allows fetching
                                 older runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes.
                                 Currently, you must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not
                                 supported
            --chain <chain>      Provide the name of a chain and a random url amongst a list of known
                                 nodes will be used. If you pass a valid --chain, --url will be ignored
                                 --chain local = http://localhost:9933
        -o, --output <output>    You may specifiy the output filename where the runtime will be saved.
                                 If not provided, we will figure out an appropriate default name based
                                 on a counter: runtime_NNN.wasm where NNN is incrementing to make sure
                                 you do not override previous runtime. If you specify an existing file
                                 as output, it will be overwritten

### Command: info

    subwasm-info 0.12.1

    The `info` command returns summarized information about a runtime

                    /tmp/runtime.wasm or a node url such as http://localhost:9933 or
                    ws://localhost:9944 [default: runtime_000.wasm]

    FLAGS:

### Command: meta

    subwasm-metadata 0.12.1
    chevdor <chevdor@gmail.com>:Wilfried Kopp <wilfried@parity.io
    Returns the metadata as a json object. You may also use the "meta" alias

    USAGE:

                                 modules. Using this flag, you will only see the module of your choice

## Sample runs

**Fetch a runtime from a running node**

We will start by fetching the runtime from a node.

Please note that you will likely need to connect to an **archive** node to retrieve older runtime. A runtime takes around 2MB of storage on-chain and thus, older versions are pruned and will no longer be accessible if you are connectin to a non-archive node.

**Here we get the latest version of the runtime, the 3 commands do the same since they all use the default values:**

    subwasm get
    subwasm get --url http://localhost:9933
    subwasm get --url http://localhost:9933 --output runtime_000.wasm

**Here we get an older runtime, back when Polkadot was at block 20 !**

    subwasm get brew tap chevdor/subwasm --block 0x4d6a0bca208b85d41833a7f35cf73d1ae6974f4bad8ab576e2c3f751d691fe6c

By default, your runtime will be saved as `runtime_000.wasm`. Running this command again will increase the counter so we you don’t lose your previous runtime. You may also use the `--output` flag to provide the destination and filename of your choice. Beware, in this case, there will be no incremented counter.

**Get quick check of a runtime**

    # Show the runtime version and exit with status 0
    subwasm info --input kusama-2030.wasm

    # Provide a few explanations and exit with a status that is not 0
    subwasm info --input tictactoe.wasm

### Metadata JSON and jq tricks

`jq` can be used to reprocess the json output. For instance, removing all the documentation from the metadata makes it significantly smaller. The example below shows how to remove `documentation`, `value` and `default` for a version easier on the eyes for human parsing…​

        subwasm --json meta runtime.wasm | jq 'del( .. | .documentation?, .default?, .value? )'

## Alternatives

Here is a list of other projects allowing to get the raw metadata through a rpc call:

-   [PolkadotJS](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps) from Jaco / Parity

-   [subsee](https://github.com/ascjones/subsee) from Andrew / Parity

-   [substrate-api-client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) from SCS

-   [subxt](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-subxt) from Parity

All those alternatives require a running node and access it via jsonrpc.
