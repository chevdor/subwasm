Returns the metadata as a json object. You may also use the "meta" alias

USAGE:
    subwasm metadata [OPTIONS] [SOURCE]

ARGS:
    <SOURCE>    The wasm file to load. It can be a path on your local filesystem such as
                /tmp/runtime.wasm or a node url such as http://localhost:9933 or
                ws://localhost:9944 [default: runtime_000.wasm]

OPTIONS:
    -b, --block <BLOCK>      The optional block where to fetch the runtime. That allows fetching
                             older runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes.
                             Currently, you must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not
                             supported
        --chain <CHAIN>      Provide the name of a chain and a random url amongst a list of known
                             nodes will be used. If you pass a valid --chain, --url will be ignored
                             --chain local = http://localhost:9933
    -h, --help               Print help information
    -j, --json               Output as json
    -m, --module <MODULE>    Without this flag, the metadata command display the list of all
                             modules. Using this flag, you will only see the module of your choice
                             and a few details about it
    -V, --version            Print version information
