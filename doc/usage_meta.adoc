If you want to see the content of a runtime, see the `show` sub-command.

Usage: subwasm metadata [OPTIONS] [FILE]

Arguments:
  [FILE]
          The wasm file to load. It can be a path on your local filesystem such as /tmp/runtime.wasm or a node url such as http://localhost:9933 or ws://localhost:9944

Options:
  -c, --chain <CHAIN>
          Provide the name of a chain and a random url amongst a list of known nodes will be used. If you pass a valid --chain, --url will be ignored --chain local = http://localhost:9933

  -u, --url <URL>
          Load the wasm from a URL (no node) such as <https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/download/v0.9.42/polkadot_runtime-v9420.compact.compressed.wasm>

  -g, --github <GITHUB>
          Load the wasm from Github passing a string in the format `<runtime>@<version>` such as `kusama@0.9.42`

  -b, --block <BLOCK>
          The optional block where to fetch the runtime. That allows fetching older runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes. Currently, you must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not supported

  -m, --module <MODULE>
          Without this flag, the metadata command display the list of all modules. Using this flag, you will only see the module of your choice and a few details about it

          [default: human]

  -o, --output <OUTPUT>
          You may specifiy the output filename where the metadata will be saved. Alternatively, you may use `auto` and an appropriate name will be generated according to the `format` your chose

  -j, --json

  -n, --no-color
          [env: NO_COLOR=]
