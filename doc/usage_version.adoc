The `version` command returns summarized information about the versions of a runtime

Usage: subwasm version [OPTIONS] [SOURCE]

Arguments:
  [SOURCE]  The wasm file to load. It can be a path on your local filesystem such as /tmp/runtime.wasm or a node url such as http://localhost:9933 or ws://localhost:9944 [default: runtime_000.wasm]

Options:
      --chain <CHAIN>  Provide the name of a chain and a random url amongst a list of known nodes will be used. If you pass a valid --chain, --url will be ignored --chain local = http://localhost:9933
  -j, --json           Output as json
  -b, --block <BLOCK>  The optional block where to fetch the runtime. That allows fetching older runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes. Currently, you must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not supported
  -h, --help           Print help information
  -V, --version        Print version information
