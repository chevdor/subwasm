The `info` command returns summarized information about a runtime

USAGE:
    subwasm info [OPTIONS] [SOURCE]

ARGS:
    <SOURCE>    The wasm file to load. It can be a path on your local filesystem such as
                /tmp/runtime.wasm or a node url such as http://localhost:9933 or
                ws://localhost:9944 [default: runtime_000.wasm]

OPTIONS:
    -b, --block <BLOCK>    The optional block where to fetch the runtime. That allows fetching older
                           runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes. Currently, you
                           must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not supported
        --chain <CHAIN>    Provide the name of a chain and a random url amongst a list of known
                           nodes will be used. If you pass a valid --chain, --url will be ignored
                           --chain local = http://localhost:9933
    -h, --help             Print help information
    -j, --json             Output as json
    -V, --version          Print version information
