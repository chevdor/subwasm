Decompress a given runtime wasm file. You may pass a runtime that is uncompressed already. In that
case, you will get the same content as output. This is useful if you want to decompress "no matter
what" and don't really know whether the input will be compressed or not

USAGE:
    subwasm decompress [OPTIONS] <INPUT> <OUTPUT>

ARGS:
    <INPUT>     The path of the compressed or uncompressed wasm file to load
    <OUTPUT>    The path of the file where the uncompressed runtime will be stored

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help       Print help information
    -j, --json       Output as json
    -V, --version    Print version information
