Decompress a given runtime wasm file. You may pass a runtime that is uncompressed already. In that case, you will get the same content as output. This is useful if you want to decompress "no matter what" and don't really know whether the input will be compressed or not

Usage: subwasm decompress [OPTIONS] <INPUT> <OUTPUT>

Arguments:
  <INPUT>   The path of the compressed or uncompressed wasm file to load
  <OUTPUT>  The path of the file where the uncompressed runtime will be stored

Options:
  -j, --json     Output as json
  -h, --help     Print help information
  -V, --version  Print version information
