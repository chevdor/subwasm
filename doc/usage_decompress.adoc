Decompress a given runtime wasm file. You may pass a runtime that is already uncompressed.

In that case, you will get the same content as output. This is useful if you want to decompress "no matter what" and don't really know whether the input will be compressed or not.

Usage: subwasm decompress [OPTIONS] <INPUT> <OUTPUT>

Arguments:
  <INPUT>
          The path of the compressed or uncompressed wasm file to load

  <OUTPUT>
          The path of the file where the uncompressed runtime will be stored

Options:
  -j, --json
          Output as json

  -n, --no-color
          Do not write color information to the output. This is recommended for scripts
          
          [env: NO_COLOR=]

  -q, --quiet
          Less output

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
