Shows the a reduced view of the runtime.

A reduced view makes it much easier to understand the inner workings of a given runtime.

Usage: subwasm show [OPTIONS] [FILE]

Arguments:
  [FILE]
          The runtimwe to analyze

Options:
      --chain <CHAIN>
          Provide the name of a chain and a random url amongst a list of known nodes will be used. If you pass a valid --chain, --url will be ignored --chain local = http://localhost:9933

  -b, --block <BLOCK>
          The optional block where to fetch the runtime. That allows fetching older runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes. Currently, you must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not supported

  -u, --url <URL>
          Load the wasm from a URL (no node) such as <https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/download/v0.9.42/polkadot_runtime-v9420.compact.compressed.wasm>

  -g, --github <GITHUB>
          Load the wasm from Github passing a string in the format `<runtime>@<version>` such as `kusama@0.9.42`

  -p, --pallet <PALLET>
          Show only information related to the provided pallet

  -s, --summary
          The runtime is shown as a table, listing all pallets with their IDs, the count of calls, events, errors, constants and storage items

  -j, --json
          Output as json

  -n, --no-color
          [env: NO_COLOR=]

  -q, --quiet
          Less output

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
