Get/Download the runtime wasm from a running node through rpc

Usage: subwasm get [OPTIONS] [URL]

Arguments:
  [URL]  The node url including (mandatory) the port number. Example: ws://localhost:9944 or http://localhost:9933 [default: http://localhost:9933]

Options:
      --chain <CHAIN>    Provide the name of a chain and a random url amongst a list of known nodes will be used. If you pass a valid --chain, --url will be ignored --chain local = http://localhost:9933
  -j, --json             Output as json
  -b, --block <BLOCK>    The optional block where to fetch the runtime. That allows fetching older runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes. Currently, you must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not supported
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>  You may specifiy the output filename where the runtime will be saved. If not provided, we will figure out an appropriate default name based on a counter: runtime_NNN.wasm where NNN is incrementing to make sure you do not override previous runtime. If you specify an existing file as output, it will be overwritten
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
