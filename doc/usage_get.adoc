Get/Download the runtime wasm from a running node through rpc

Usage: subwasm get [OPTIONS] [RPC_URL]

Arguments:
  [RPC_URL]
          The node url including (mandatory) the port number. Example: ws://localhost:9944 or http://localhost:9933

Options:
  -c, --chain <CHAIN>
          Provide the name of a chain or an alias.
          
          If you pass a valid --chain, --rpc_url will be ignored --chain local = http://localhost:9933

  -b, --block <BLOCK>
          The optional block where to fetch the runtime.
          
          That allows fetching older runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes. Currently, you must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not supported.

  -u, --url <URL>
          Load the wasm from a URL (no node) such as <https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/download/v0.9.42/polkadot_runtime-v9420.compact.compressed.wasm>

  -g, --github <GITHUB>
          Load the wasm from Github passing a string in the format `<runtime>@<version>` such as `kusama@0.9.42`

  -o, --output <OUTPUT>
          You may specifiy the output filename where the runtime will be saved.
          
          If not provided, we will figure out an appropriate default name based on a counter: runtime_NNN.wasm where NNN is incrementing to make sure you do not override previous runtime. If you specify an existing file as output, it will be overwritten.

  -j, --json
          Output as json

  -n, --no-color
          Do not write color information to the output. This is recommended for scripts
          
          [env: NO_COLOR=]

  -q, --quiet
          Less output

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
