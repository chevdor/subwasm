Get/Download the runtime wasm from a running node through rpc

USAGE:
    subwasm get [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [URL]

ARGS:
    <URL>    The node url including (mandatory) the port number. Example: ws://localhost:9944 or
             http://localhost:9933 [default: http://localhost:9933]

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Print help information
    -j, --json       Output as json
    -V, --version    Print version information

OPTIONS:
    -b, --block <BLOCK>      The optional block where to fetch the runtime. That allows fetching
                             older runtimes but you will need to connect to archive nodes.
                             Currently, you must pass a block hash. Passing the block numbers is not
                             supported
        --chain <CHAIN>      Provide the name of a chain and a random url amongst a list of known
                             nodes will be used. If you pass a valid --chain, --url will be ignored
                             --chain local = http://localhost:9933
    -o, --output <OUTPUT>    You may specifiy the output filename where the runtime will be saved.
                             If not provided, we will figure out an appropriate default name based
                             on a counter: runtime_NNN.wasm where NNN is incrementing to make sure
                             you do not override previous runtime. If you specify an existing file
                             as output, it will be overwritten
